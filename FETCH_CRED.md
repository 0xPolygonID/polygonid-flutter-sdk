# Fetch and Save Credentials

## Preparatory steps

Please follow these [steps here](https://github.com/0xPolygonID/polygonid-flutter-sdk/blob/develop/AUTH.md) if you have not already done so, in order to correctly initialise the sdk and authenticate yourself on an issuer provider

## Fetch and Save method

The Polygon ID Flutter SDK provides an easy-to-use method for fetching a list of [ClaimEntity](https://github.com/0xPolygonID/polygonid-flutter-sdk/blob/develop/lib/credential/domain/entities/claim_entity.dart) objects from an issuer (like https://issuer-demo-testing-testnet.polygonid.me/) and storing them in the Polygon ID SDK.

This process is handled with the `fetchAndSaveClaims` function:

```dart
Future<List<ClaimEntity>> fetchAndSaveClaims({
    required Iden3MessageEntity message,
    required String genesisDid,
    BigInt? profileNonce,
    required String privateKey
});
```

The parameters to provide to this function are:

- `message`: an `Iden3MessageEntity` object, which contains the iden3comm message entity.
- `genesisDid`: a `String` representing the unique id of the identity.
- `profileNonce`: a `BigInt` (optional) representing the nonce of the profile used from identity to obtain the did identifier.
- `privateKey`: a `String` used to access all sensitive info from the identity and also to perform operations like generating proofs.

Here's an example of a JSON object returned by an issuer:

```json
{
  "id": "731fbb15-25cd-4148-88da-895f0ccfd78a",
  "typ": "application/iden3comm-plain-json",
  "type": "https://iden3-communication.io/credentials/1.0/offer",
  "thid": "731fbb15-25cd-4148-88da-895f0ccfd78a",
  "body": {
    "url": "https://issuer-testing-testnet.polygonid.me/v1/agent",
    "credentials": [
      {
        "id": "6240925f-05f8-11ee-9dc5-0242ac180005",
        "description": "KYCAgeCredential"
      }
    ]
  },
  "from": "did:polygonid:polygon:mumbai:2qFXmNqGWPrLqDowKz37Gq2FETk4yQwVUVUqeBLmf9",
  "to": "did:polygonid:polygon:mumbai:2qKaEw4sFmKD1JA59fnXA3d6BTeAsdyeEkVRs37W8P"
}
```

The `Iden3MessageEntity` can be obtained by passing the scanned String to this sdk methods:
```dart
Iden3MessageEntity message = await PolygonIdSdk.I.iden3comm.getIden3Message(
  message: "YOUR_SCANNED_STRING"
);
```

After using the `fetchAndSaveClaims` function, the list of credentials will be stored in the Polygon ID SDK. You can retrieve these credentials using the `getClaims` function:

```dart
Future<List<ClaimEntity>> getClaims({
    List<FilterEntity>? filters,
    required String genesisDid,
    required String privateKey
});
```

This function returns a list of `ClaimEntity` objects associated with the identity, previously stored in the Polygon ID SDK. You can filter this list using the `filters` parameter. It also requires the `genesisDid` and `privateKey` parameters, as described above.

This handling of credentials simplifies the process, making it easier to fetch, store, and retrieve credentials in your application.
